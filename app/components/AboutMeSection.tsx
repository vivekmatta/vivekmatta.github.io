						I am a Purdue University graduate with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Engineering, where I gained hands-on experience in embedded systems, robotics, and hardware-software integration. Currently, I am pursuing my M.Eng. in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University, continuing my passion for bridging the gap between hardware and software.

						When I&apos;m not coding or designing circuits, you can find me hanging out with friends, working on personal projects, or watching movies. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and finding inspiration from both technical challenges and everyday experiences.
